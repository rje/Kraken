title: Templating is in, storage/adding to go
date: Wed Aug 4 2010

With a bit more work I've gotten templating for some hardcoded test posts 
working, and a bit of simple css to make the layout a bearable if not pretty.

There are two bits remaining before I can really put it up on the web:

1. Need a way to add/edit/remove posts.  I don't particularly care how I do this
for 0.1, so it may be sqlite or mysql on the command line for ease of 
implementation.

2. Running the templates every time is really slow, so caching the pages each 
time they need to regenerate would be way better.  If I make a small admin
page for #1, then I can just invalidate the caches on save.  Maybe use an
atom per page?
