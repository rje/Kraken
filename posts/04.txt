title: Step 1 - Basic framework and serving static files
date: Fri Jul 30 2010

As a first step I want to create two pieces:
1. A simple handler that can handle routing a request to different functions
depending on what the request is.
2. A handler to return static files.

I figure this is the "hello world" of web frameworks, so it's a good place to
start.
