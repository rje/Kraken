title: Tech Stack -- web server & build tool
date: Fri Jul 30 2010
After looking at Compojure (http://weavejester.github.com/compojure/), Ring (http://github.com/mmcgrana/ring) and Aleph (http://github.com/ztellman/aleph) I decided I'd start this project using Aleph as my base.

Aleph is a project to build an asynchronous web server on top of Netty (http://www.jboss.org/netty).  It's early on in development and fairly low level, but I
think it's conceptually interesting and will provide an interesting learning expexperience.  As an added benefit, it's almost completely compatible with Ring, so if I need to transition over at any point it shouldn't be terribly difficult.

For my project building tool, I'm going to be using leiningen (http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).  It's really easy to get up and running with, and it appears to be the defacto tool of the Clojure community.  To be fair, I did not
spend any significant amount of time looking for alternatives here -- most documentation/getting started guides/etc all mentioned leiningen so that's what I'll start with.

I wrote a small "getting started" for Aleph using leiningen that you can look at here: http://wiki.github.com/rje/aleph/hello-world-with-aleph
