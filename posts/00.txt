title: Kraken - a small blogging platform written in clojure
date: Fri Jul 30 2010

Q: What the hell is this?
A: Kraken is a small blogging platform written in Clojure.  I'm using it to
run my personal blog at http://rjevans.net.

Q: Why are you making a new blogging platform instead of using <something else>?
A: It's a fair question.  I don't have a ton of needs in a blogging system, I
just want something that will let me post content painlessly and embed a few
types of data.  Frankly tumblr or posterous would work perfectly well from a
feature standpoint.  But the real goal behind the project is to take a fairly
straightforward problem (blogging) and use it as an impetus for learning 
Clojure and the various other tools that I incorporate into Kraken.

Q: What's libraries/technologies are you using?
A: Outside of programming in Clojure, I have no idea yet. I'm currently 
evaluating a bunch of stuff and will talk about the options in a future post.
But the plan is to use pre-existing libraries/solutions where they fit well
and write new libraries to fill any gaps.
