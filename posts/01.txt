title: Kraken - 0.1 feature list
date: Fri Jul 30 2010

My goal for 0.1 is to get the blog up and running as soon as possible, with a minimal amount of polish.  It just needs to _work_.

(For those who are reading this on the web, I actually am writing these initial posts in text files, that I plan on uplaoding to the blog once it is running.)

With the simple "it needs to work" goal in mind, I have the following feature
list:
Publically visible features:
* A main page with a title, posts in order by date, and a link to a static about page.
* Post titles should be clickable and go to a page that displays only that post.
* A static about page that lists a few things about me, because I crave attention.

Behind the scenes features:
* Some sort of storage for posts (sql/nosql/flat file, I don't really care for 0.1).
* Some method for adding posts, deleting posts, and editing posts.  I was originally going to say "an authenticated admin page" but that may not be the quickest
way to get up and running.

I think those 5 bullet points are it for 0.1.  Once I have those bits up and running I'll be able to get all these blog posts on the web, which will be a great "small victory" for the project.
