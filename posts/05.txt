title: serving static files is go!
date: Fri Jul 30 2010

So as per the last post, I now have a very simple routing function, it's basic
flow is:
<code>
  (cond (= &lt;some future dynamic path&gt;) (return-dynamic-content ...)
        ... (other dynamic paths) ...
        (static-files/file-exists? (:uri request)) (return-file ...)
        :else (return-404))
</code>

I'm sure this will change eventually, but it's more than sufficient to get started.

Right now all the static files have to be in a "public" subdirectory of the project.  In a future revision this will need to be part of a configuration file (along with other things like the port, datastore configuration, etc), but hardcoded will work for 0.1.

Next I want to find a way to throw some dynamic content into a template.  That plus the static file support I just made should be enough to get the basics of a main page going.
