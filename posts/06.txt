title: Templating
date: Tue Aug  3 2010

I'm going to try and use enlive for my basic templating, as I may or may not
have mentioned before.  I've got a basic index page with a single tag getting
replaced as a test, and so far things seem to be going well.  I need to figure
out how to support inserting snippets (one for each blog post on the main page)
and I need to figure out some basic caching to help prevent the server from
getting slammed, but that should be all that's really needed on the template
side of things for 0.1.

I've also worked out an improved solution for routing, I now have a table of
regex/controller function pairs.  An incoming uri is matched to the first
controller where the regex key matches.  If none of the controllers match,
I fallback to see if a static file exists for that URI.  If that doesn't
exist, then I fall back to a 404 error.  This should help me be able to keep
all of the relevant templating logic, loading/saving code, etc in separate
namespaces/files for the different controllers.
