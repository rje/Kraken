*kraken*

Kraken is a small web framework that I'm using to run my website at http://rjevans.net.  My goal is to make a simple and lightweight basis that people can use for a variety of webapps.  Kraken uses aleph for the base server functionality, and I recommend enlive for html templates.

*Usage*

You really shouldn't be using it yet -- this section will be updated with usage once the project is, well, usable.

*Installation*

See: Usage.
